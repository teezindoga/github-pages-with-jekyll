So when I talk about coming at a niche from a different angle, this example is exactly what I mean. 
Skint Dad is a site that helps young / new dads save money and be more frugal in their day to day living.
There’s also a section on their that shows guys how to make a little more cash on top of their monthly day job wage,
which is vital in some cases just to keep your head above water. 
A lot of new dads have the added stress of not having their wives’ or girlfriends’ wage coming in each month,
due to the temporary career change in being a full time mum of a baby.
So having some content around how they can make a few extra “Ps” in their wallet each month, can ease the burden somewhat.
